<!-- ABOUT THE LIBRARY -->
## About The Library

This toolchain is based on compilation with SDCC and programming the controller with STVP. This allows you to use all the features of C99 standard and use any programmer that is supported by STVP.

In addition to this, unused functions are removed during compilation with the use of sdccrm.

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Installation

Follow all the steps below for desired functionality of the toolchain.

Disclaimer: the steps are described for windows because i suppose linux users are much smarter than windows users so they don't need to be guided XD

You may have some of these tools already downloaded.
